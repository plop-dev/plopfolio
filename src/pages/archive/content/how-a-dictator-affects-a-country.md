## How a dictator affects a country

<br>

---
<br>

Over 50 countries are affected by dictators. In each one of those countries, millions of people suffer daily, fighting to feed their families. Imagine being oppressed to the point that you don’t have a voice in any decision that affects you. Imagine having no freedom in your life; not being able to choose what you want to wear or when you want to work. Imagine not being able to receive any healthcare or have your children attend school. Children are deprived of education having no visible future of being more than a slave to their country. This is a harsh reality too many people must endure.

By definition, a dictatorship is a form of government, where one person effectively has all the power to run a country. This also includes small, oligarchic governments where people don't have a voice. The consequences of this can be devastating for any country's economy, social stability, and even environment. For example, hyperinflation can occur when some dictators will try to take on giant public projects or achieve a huge military, but these all require large amounts of money. A simple solution is printing money, but it will consequently result in inflation. People will struggle even more to live a healthy and normal life, and even more will fall into extreme poverty. This was seen in Zimbabwe in 2007 when inflation increased by 25,000%.

However, manipulating a whole population isn't always effective since violating human rights cannot be ignored by those affected. In the workplace, workers are forced to work in inhumane conditions that may take their lives. In Uzbekistan, the cotton industry heavily impacted adults and children with forced labour whilst being neglected and violated. Without a voice or opinion, they cannot avoid this fate and are helpless.

It's not only the citizens being affected. The dictators themselves can be troubled by ruling a country, usually alone, for long periods. A common dilemma dictators face is called the 'dictator effect'. This happens when they get addicted to the feeling of being in charge or being the most powerful due to the release of dopamine.  Contrary to belief, this makes them smarter and more focused. Consequently, they will be less empathetic and less open to outside criticism. This will make them paranoid that close ones will betray them which leads them into isolation. Subsequently, their decision-making will degrade over time, and they will struggle to keep the country stable.

All these horrific consequences cannot be ignored. It's crucial to recognise that we have a role in fighting against these regimes. We must help them have normal lives where they can create lifelong memories with their families and see their children have a future. Human rights are a basic necessity, and we can't let anyone abuse them. Think about the millions of men, women, and children worrying about whether they'll eat the next day. As citizens of wealthy countries, these thoughts will rarely cross our minds and if they do, we will have a helping hand like friends and family or a charity. Some people don't even have this luxury; we need to take action whether it's a small or significant act, you are still saving lives. You could raise awareness through social media or writing to a newspaper. You could also help by donating to charities that are working to fight against dictators like Freedom House which supports democracy advocates and human rights defenders across the world.

To stand by and ignore is to be complicit in the suffering of millions. Shin Dong-hyuk was born in one of North Korea’s most notorious concentration camps. He was born a political prisoner due to the “sins” of his family, as his father was imprisoned for reasons he never fully understood. The tasks he had to do were gruelling and dangerous such as mining and farming, with minimal food or medical care. He was forced to witness public executions of his own family who attempted to escape and was blamed for not reporting them, leading to further punishment. After years of enduring pain, Shin managed to escape from the camp before reaching South Korea. He became a human rights activist, writing books and raising awareness about the human rights abuses of North Korea. We can fight and protest together like Shin to build foundations in supporting democracy and human rights across the globe. There are so many various ways to get involved and help to make a difference. We can solve this issue step by step, together.

Thank you for listening.
